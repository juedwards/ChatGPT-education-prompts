Welcome to the "New Bing / ChatGPT Prompts for Educators" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples for educators to be used with the Bing tool [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) or ChatGPT model.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with Bing/ChatGPT for education purposes. I encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use ChatGPT to generate new prompts as well.
